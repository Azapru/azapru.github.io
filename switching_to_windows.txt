I was using GNU/Linux for pretty long time now, it's still my favourite OS ever.
But sadly I'm switching back to Windows, it's not because there's something wrong with GNU/Linux,
it's more because I have skill issue, not even kidding, every or even all of my issues
could be fixed if I had knoweldge or skill, but I don't have, and I don't have time
for learning that stuff and getting that skill.



So the main reasons I'm switching back is:

- My laptop just doesn't wanna work too good with my Arch linux, and this is prime example of my skill issue,
    there are 100% ways to fix the issues but I don't know how, some of these issues with laptop are
    that sleep just doesn't work correctly, or that it consumes more power then on Windows...

- Gaming; So I don't really do much gaming but I'm pretty unlucky with games I play,
    so I'm going to list games I am mainly playing and their issues:

        * Muse Dash - the only game with absolutly no issues, working fine

        * Friday Night Funkin (Mods) - So I don't play it that much anymore, but when I want,
            it just straight up crashes my display driver and breaks everything related to it,
            most of the times

        * Roblox - so they banned usage of Wine, yeah

        * Genshin Impact - sometimes I want to play on PC, on big screen with massive speakers (without
        caring about lower graphics and small FPS drops)

        * Honkai Star Rail - no way of playing it on Linux without getting banned at this moment

        * Osu! - lagzz

        (performance issues are mostly because my graphic card doesn't work that well with Vulkan API)

- Printing: It's just a myth in Linux community

- And of course; Wallpaper Engine



But switching back doesn't mean I will not miss things, I will miss a lot of things in fact... Including:

- AUR and installing packages from terminal, it's just so easy and simple, no need to touch mouse and go to
    sketchy websites to download some software.

- FOSS software, so GNU/Linux is basically just FOSS, and on Windows I nonstop run into paywalls in every fucking app
    I download.

- Customizability of KDE Plasma

- System performance, GNU/Linux is still a system performance king



And before someone asks: "If you have problem with skill issue and can't get your Arch running good on your PC, why
                            not just use more stable distro built by someone else? Like Fedora or Debian"
                        Answer: I don't like any other distros really, and if I'm on Linux, I can't live without AUR
                                and if I use PPAs in Ubuntu I always break everything, with dependency hell and
                                outdated software

But don't worry, switching from Desktop GNU/Linux to Windows doesn't mean I will stop following the Linux community,
I will still be very active and will be following progress on things like Valve's Proton or Wayland or New Open-Source Nvidia Drivers

Also, right after finishing installing Windows 10, I will debloat it as fast as possible (but not too much, so microsoft store doesn't
break, it's still pretty important thing in Windows...), I still hate Microsoft.

And one last thing, when I get new PC, I will most likely hop back on desktop Linux :D
Let's hope it won't take long

Wallpaper engine my love, I'm coming back!
