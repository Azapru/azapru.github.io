            This page explains how to submit your own single/EP/album (not a track for a compilation!).
        </div>

        <p class="title">■How to submit?</p>
        <div class="text-area">
            Just contact Azapru either through Discord (user: azapru) or their email (contact@azapru.xyz). There's no particular format you need to follow, if we will need anything more, we will just ask you. Although, we require your tracks to be in either (24-bit 44.1kHz) WAV or (24-bit 44.1kHz) FLAC format.

        <p class="title">■Is my release good enough? / does it fit the label?</p>
        <div class="text-area">
            It depends! You can always just ask us! If your release falls under any sub-genres of Hardcore or Breakcore, it should be fine!    
        </div>

        <p class="title">■Do you release on streaming?</p>
        <div class="text-area">
            As long as your release doesn't contain any copyrighted content, we CAN release your album/EP/single on the streaming platforms! But it's your choice if you want to or not. If your release contains copyrighted content, we can only release it on Bandcamp. 
        </div>

        <p class="title">■Do I make money from my releases?</p>
        <div class="text-area">
            Yes! While there are currently no earnings from streaming services due to our low popularity, we still get money from Bandcamp purchases/donations. Just DM Azapru if you want to receive money made from your release (if there are any of course). We keep 0% of money you make from your releases, but you can decide to not receive anything, then the money will be used as label funds!
        </div>

        <p class="title">■Cover arts</p>
        <div class="text-area">
            If you don't already have a cover art for your release, you can comission Azapru. The prices range from 0€ to 5€ for cover arts with no characters (like <a href="../AZCTSP-001/" target="_blank">Reminiscent Dystopia</a>) or 20€ to 30€ for cover arts with characters (like <a href="../AZCT-002/" target="_blank">ACUTECORE II</a>). For more details please contact them.
