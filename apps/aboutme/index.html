                <p class="aboutme-p">- Just a silly boy on the internet who makes dark hardcore music and draws cute boys! (I can also code I guess)</p>

                <p class="aboutme-p">This website works like a real desktop! You can move the windows around, change focus, resize them, open multiple apps, etc., try it! (Most things sadly don't work on touch/mobile BTW)</p>
                <p class="aboutme-p">You can find links to my music, artworks and socials in the <span class="link" onclick="open_app('socials')">All Socials</span> app.</p>
                <p class="aboutme-p-small">(BTW This website was designed with Desktop PCs in mind, but I'm trying to make it somehow usable on mobile!! Like maximized windows or bigger close button.)</p>
